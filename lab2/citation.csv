Many sites are monitored using nestboxes which the animals utilise and anyone opening these nestboxes and disturbing dormice needs to hold a licence from Natural England or Natural Resources Wales to do so.

This sensitive information may be made available under licence to specific organisations and individuals that need to know to avoid harm to the environment.
